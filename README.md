### Food Preferences of College Students

This dataset is a merged dataset from two previous datasets that include students' preferences in life, sports, food, GPA, height, weight
and other parameters, and a second dataset (taken from the exact same participants) entirely on food preferences of them and their parents. 


##### Work in Progress

This dataset will be explored in Python to see what trends, relationship between variables, or other significant findings can be found.
